# PythonConsoleRPG
A small but sweet python RPG with a coordinate system, battle system, and tons of towns and features!

## How to Play
Download the **main.py** file from the main branch and then run it right in the console using the python compiler.

## What is the point of the Game?
Though the game may seem linear, it surprisingly has an ending I promise!
The goal of the game is to become strong enough, then make your way to the mayors office to defeat the final boss! Pretty cool right?

## Help!!! I keep dying and I don't know what to do!

- **Don't go too far:** As fun as it is to explore the map, don't dive deep into the map too far! That's where the big enemies spawn, be sure to grind out slimes in the starter areas of the game until your more powerful.
- **Stock up on Potions:** Be sure to make frequent stops at the shop to stock up on items that can help you in battle.
